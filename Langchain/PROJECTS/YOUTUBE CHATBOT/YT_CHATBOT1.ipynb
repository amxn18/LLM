The video also introduces p99, a statistical measure that represents the 99th percentile of response times, highlighting the fastest 99% of responses. Additionally, it briefly touches on the client-server model, where a client requests information and a server provides it. The video aims to help viewers understand these key performance metrics in system design and encourages viewers to check out other related videos.'"
