            "3 hours ago - IPL 2026 Retention List Highlights: After all 10 teams released their released and retained lists for IPL 2026 ahead of the auctions, there were a few surprises with Chennai Super Kings releasing Matheesha Pathirana, Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra, Kolkata letting go of players like Andre Russell, Quinton de Kock and Venkatesh Iyer and Lucknow Super Giants sending Ravi Bishnoi into the auction pool. 3 hours ago - The Shreyas Iyer-led side lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2025 final. PBKS haven't won an IPL title yet. ... CSK's retention list is here: Ruturaj Gaikwad (Captain), Ayush Mhatre, M.S. 16 hours ago - Earlier, charismatic all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and keeper-batter Sanju Samson have been traded to Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings respectively. With the deadline for player retention ending later on Sunday, CSK stalwart Jadeja has switched base to Rajasthan Royals albeit at a much reduced fee, while Samson, who has led RR for four seasons, will be donning the yellow CSK jersey in IPL 2026. 18 hours ago - MS Dhoni was retained . Glenn Maxwell, Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and Ravi Bishnoi were among the other big names released by their respective teams. In contrast to the virtual reset that comes with retentions before mega auctions - where ... 18 hours ago - The West Indies all-rounder has been poised with a move away for some time now, and even in the IPL 2025 mega auction, he was a last-minute inclusion to the Retention List. But Dre-Russ may have run his race with KKR!! ... Unlike the IPL 2025 mega auction, the IPL 2026 edition features a mini-auction scheduled for December 16, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, where released players and new entrants will compete for contracts.\n"
