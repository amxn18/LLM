Scholars \\nsuggest that our identities are also tied to the notion \\nof \u201cwhat we do\u201d (Christiansen, 1999), and that who \\nwe are is determined partly by our occupational iden -\\ntity (Skorikov and Vondracek, 2011). However, work \\nis time consuming\u2014the American Time Use Survey \\nshows that in 2017 workers spent an average 8.21 \\nhours each day engaged in work and work-related \\nactivities (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018). Given the \\noverarching centrality of work in daily life, research -\\ners and policymakers have increasingly turned their \\nattention to examining job quality.\\nThough it is not easily defined, job quality can \\nbroadly be described as the features of employ -\\nment affecting an individual\u2019s well-being (OECD, \\n2014). Job quality is a multidimensional concept, with \\nconsiderable disagreement regarding how to best \\nmeasure it (Burchell et al., 2014; Findlay, Kalleberg, \\nand Warhurst, 2013; Mu\u00f1oz de Bustillo et al., 2011). \\nStudies examining job quality have focused on a \\nwide range of indicators including nonwage benefits, \\nemployment security, and individual control over job \\nschedule and autonomy (Howell and Kalleberg, 2019). \\nScholars also note that job quality\u2014and more broadly \\nwork quality\u2014may depend on workers\u2019 assessment \\nof their own individual circumstances, values, and \\nemployment conditions (Cooke, Donaghey, and \\nZeytinoglu, 2013).\\nTo further understand how some features of job qual-\\nity vary across the labor market, the current report \\ndescribes objective characteristics that are associated \\nwith individuals\u2019 employment and notes how these fea-\\ntures differ by occupation. Moreover, this report evalu-\\nates the relationship between occupation and each \\nobjective characteristic separately. Because individuals \\nmay assign different value or meaning to similar jobs \\nbased on their own personal preferences, this report \\ndoes not assess overall job quality or desirability.\\n1\\nUsing data from two surveys administered by the \\nU.S. Census Bureau, this report highlights common \\nfeatures of employment among the U.S. population, \\nincluding their occupations, work schedules, earn -\\nings, and other job characteristics.\\n2 The data mainly \\ncome from the 2018 Survey of Income and Program \\nParticipation (SIPP)\u2014a survey that is administered \\nannually and asks respondents about their living \\nsituation and employment during the preceding \\ncalendar year.3 Select figures also use data from \\nthe 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year \\nestimates to identify jobs with especially high or low \\nearnings, and to highlight the earnings variation that \\nexists within more broadly aggregated occupation \\ncategories.\\n\u00b9 The overall job quality associated with an occupation likely \\ndepends on the joint relationship between occupation and all objec -\\ntive characteristics. This report does not attempt such an analysis.\\n\u00b2 The U.S. Census Bureau reviewed this data product for \\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information and approved \\nthe disclosure avoidance practices applied to this release. \\nCBDRB-FY21-POP001-0225.\\n\u00b3 For technical documentation and more information about \\nSIPP data quality, please visit the SIPP website\u2019s Technical \\nDocumentation page at < www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/\\ntech-documentation.html >.')"
